# Google Sheets connector

This plugin provides a read and write connector to interact with [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/sheets/about/) documents, that are commonly named spreadsheets.

## How to set-up

* Install the plugin in Dataiku DSS. The plugin requires the installation of a code env.
* Get a `Service account` from the Google API Console with the `Sheets API` enabled. Export the credentials as a `JSON` file.
* Create a new dataset with this connector. Fill the 4 parameters and click on the `Test & Get schema` button. Then, `save` and `explore`.
* Share the spreadsheet with the email of the service account (likely in a similar form of `...@developer.gserviceaccount.com`).

## How to get the JSON Service Account

The plugin uses the protocol [OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount) to connect to the Google Sheets API.

In order to use the plugin, you will need service account's credentials exported in a JSON file with the Sheets API enabled. To generate this JSON, you can follow [the instructions on the plugin page](https://www.dataiku.com/dss/plugins/info/googlesheets.html).

## Changelog
