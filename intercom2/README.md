# Intercom plugin

This plugin provides a read connector to interact with [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com), a SaaS customer messaging platform, in [Dataiku DSS](http://www.dataiku.com/dss/). You can import users, leads, companies, admins, conversations, tags, segments through Segment API.

When available, the plugin uses the `scroll` endpoint (for example, see the documentation for [/users/scroll](https://developers.intercom.com/reference#iterating-over-all-users)). It allows one to fetch more than 10,000 but it has disadvantages: only 1 scroll can be open at a time (so concurrent recipes runs are not possible), and the scroll is unlocked when all records are fetched or after a timeout (so the plugin will always fetch all records).

## How to set-up

* Get an Intercom [Access Token](https://developers.intercom.com/v2.0/docs/personal-access-tokens) with Extended Scopes.
* Install the plugin in DSS.
* Create a new dataset with this connector. Fill the “Access Token“ and the other fields. Click on the “Test & Get schema“ button. Then, “save“ and “explore“.
